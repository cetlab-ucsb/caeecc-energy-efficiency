# CAEECC Underserved Public Sector Customers in Energy Efficiency Programs Project

This repository holds the code and data for the paper: "Inequity in public sector energy efficiency? Explaining disparities in program budgets in California, United States" accepted in the Energy Research and Social Science journal. 

This study focuses on potential inequities in access to energy efficiency programs for public sector entities including public schools and local governments. We employ t-tests and multivariate regressions to investigate potential drivers of differences in program budget including rurality, tax revenues, income, race, and disadvantaged status indicators.
